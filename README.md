Execution environment configuration and sample playbooks for hyperscaler provisioning

Given a host running Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) Controller / Hub, the default execution environment "ee-supported-rhelX:latest" includes provisioning and control modules for Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources. This module, however, does not include support for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Microsoft Azure installed by default.
